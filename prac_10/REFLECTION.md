# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

Initially inconsistent, as I underestimated debugging time.

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

Improved with experience and better task understanding.

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

To account for unexpected challenges and prioritize tasks.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

To improve readability, efficiency, and follow coding conventions.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

To identify inefficiencies and appreciate different approaches.

Provide proper Markdown links (not bare URLs) to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past
pracs.  
For each one, write a short explanation of what was good about your review.

### Good Code Review 1

### Explanation

I suggested improving variable names for better readability and provided alternative logic to simplify a complex function.

### Good Code Review 2

https://github.com/soeyadanaraung/cp1404practicals/commit/ff3cfb415fc8c100e0ebefecb0d40925e45c1238

### Explanation

I identified and explained redundant code that could be refactored and pointed out a missing edge case that needed handling.

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?

I would add more practical examples for handling external APIs and focus on debugging strategies for real-world scenarios.

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?

I excelled at breaking down complex problems into manageable steps and writing clean, well-documented code that adhered 
to the task requirements.
